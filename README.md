## Description

This is my personal automation library. It contains helpful automation tools and scripts that I've been using while sharpening my automation skills.

## Thoughts

I have come to hate UIPath. It feels like my hands are being tied behind my back. 
The greatest sin is that it completely removed the ability to use XPath selectors in favor of their stupid web control system.
The anchors don't even work.
People online say "If you want to use code, then just use an Invoke Code activity!"
So, to use UIPath effectively, I need to start ignoring the entire point of UIPath?
How about I just don't use UIPath at all?

Anyways, here's my code.
Run the scripts in LinqPad.
